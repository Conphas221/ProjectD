# Project D Create a Blockchain (School Project)

This repository contains the code for setting up a private blockchain made for exchanging sensitive data, created in C#.

The client wanted 4 hardcoded roles(parties), each with their own specific data entry forms and folder in which to place their public PGP key.

Every data entry form has a specific set of parties it will be encrypted for, based on the requirements given by the client.
